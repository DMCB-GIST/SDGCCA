# SDGCCA: Supervised Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis for Multi-omics Integration

SDGCCA is **non-linear multi-omics integration method for dis-criminating phenotypic groups and identifying biomarker**. <br/>
SDGCCA identifies the **common and correlated information between multiple omics-data** that is important for discriminating phenotypic groups. <br/>
SDGCCA is also based on deep neural network (DNN), allowing powerful capturing non-linear part of the biological complexity.
